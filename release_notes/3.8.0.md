# Jasmine Py 3.8 Release Notes

## Summary

Updates to Jasmine Core 3.8.0. See the
[jasmine-core release notes](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/blob/main/release_notes/3.8.0.md)
for details.

## Deprecation

The Jasmine packages for Python are deprecated. We intend to continue releasing 
them through the end of the 3.x series, but after that they will be
discontinued. We recommend migrating to the following alternatives:
    
* The [jasmine-browser-runner](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine-browser)
  npm package to run specs in browsers, including headless Chrome and 
  Saucelabs. This is the most direct replacement for the `jasmine server`
  and `jasmine ci` commands provided by the `jasmine` Python package.
* The [jasmine](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine-npm) npm package (
  `npm install jasmine`) to run specs under Node.js.
* The standalone distribution from the
  [latest Jasmine release](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/releases) to 
  run specs in browsers with no additional tools.
* The [jasmine-core](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine) npm package if all
  you need is the Jasmine assets. This is the direct equivalent of the 
  jasmine-core Python package.
  
## Supported environments

The jasmine Python package has been tested on Python 3.5-3.9. See the 
[jasmine-core release notes](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/blob/main/release_notes/3.8.0.md)
for supported browsers.
