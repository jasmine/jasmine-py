# Jasmine Py 3.6 Release Notes

## Summary

Updates to Jasmine Core 3.6.0. See the
[jasmine-core release notes](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/blob/main/release_notes/3.6.0.md)
for details.

## Breaking Changes

Python 3.4 is no longer supported.

We make all reasonable efforts to maintain support for each Python version 
until the next major release of Jasmine. However, the Python ecosystem has
moved on from 3.4 to such an extent that it's no longer practical to build on
it. The only realistic way for us to continue releasing Jasmine for Python
during the remainder of the Jasmine 3.x series was to drop support for Python
3.4 now.
